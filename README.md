# LSB-Audio-Steganography-Using-2-bits
The following code contains algorithms for encoding a hidden message into an audio file using LSB steganography as well as decoding it.

A basic implementation of LSB steganography using only one bit is found here: https://sumit-arora.medium.com/audio-steganography-the-art-of-hiding-secrets-within-earshot-part-2-of-2-c76b1be719b3

The jupyter-notebook file contains a modified implementation of LSB with line by line comments to explain the code
